### 👩🏾‍💻 Development

- Eslint is used in the project to enforce code style and should be configured in your [editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).

- Prettier is also used and apply automatically by eslint

- Typescript is used in the project for type-checking and should be configured in your [editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support).

You can check this manually by running:

```bash
$ yarn lint
```

or

```bash
$ yarn typescript
```

You can ask eslint to fix issues by running:

```bash
$ yarn lint:fix
```
