# Facts

A European citizen produces around [500 kg](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Municipal_waste_statistics) of rubbish every year (1100 lb). This crazy amount of waste has to be collected by trucks, emitting a lot of CO2.

In Europe, only [30 % of the plastic is recycled](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20181212STO21610/plastic-waste-and-recycling-in-the-eu-facts-and-figures), the rest is land-filled (31%) and the remaining majority is incinerated (39 %). Plastic, unlike glass or metal, [cannot be recycled infinitely](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/plastic-waste-wish-recycling-bins-black-environment-green-shopping-a8548736.html).

# Zero Waste

To avoid plastic and single use objects in our daily life, you can try, if you have the time and the money, to transition to a zero waste lifestyle, gradually. A British agency has made a really nice [survival kit](https://useless.london/kit) if you want to get some inspiration.

Beside that, a good way to decrease your impact on the planet is buy more second hand goods: from computers, phones to clothing, you can purchase anything second hand; or even better, fix, reuse or upgrade what you already have.

# Do it yourself

A lot of products you buy at the supermarket like yogurt, soap or even deodorants are not so complicated to make yourself. For example, you can make [tawashi](https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Tawashi) (scrubbing brush) with old piece of clothes. Furthermore, it's always satisfying and entertaining to do something yourself!

You can have a look to the amazing [Low Tech Lab](https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Accueil) for more inspiration.

## Disclaimer

Shifting towards a more sustainable lifestyle is a long process and works better on the long run when it's done step by step. What's the point to change all your routines if it's give up in 6 months? Unfortunately, our capitalist society is not given us the necessary resources (time, money, education... ) to be more friendly with the environment. So take your time and don't be too hard on yourself ðŸ˜‰
