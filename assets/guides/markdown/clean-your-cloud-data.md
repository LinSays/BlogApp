# Clean your cloud data

When your data is saved on the cloud, it means it's saved on remote computers (servers). It's really nice and convenient because if you lose your computer or your phone, your data is not lost!

However, redundant data is not environmentally friendly at all and will never be. Remember this: every time you save data, transfer data it means CO2 emissions.

Servers as well as your devices needs many rare metals but also because it needs electricity to work. For the servers, it's every single day of the year with no down time, to make sure you can access your data at any time of the day. As you know, electricity production always emits CO2, even if it's solar, windmills or nuclear. Yes, there is no "green" energy and solar panels manufacturing pollutes a lot.

Therefore, the less emails you have on your mailbox, the less data you have on the cloud, the better for the environment. 

### More data = more pollution
