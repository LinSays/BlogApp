### When necessary, buy a phone & computer you can upgrade and repair with a long lifespan

A lot of people are changing their hardware it is a bit outdated, because they want a better camera or because the battery is not working well anymore.

Changing equipment every year is not sustainable and it's bad for the environment. To face this issue, a Dutch company, [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/), is making ethical and modular phone that you can fix and upgrade yourself. It's also worth mentioning brands like OnePlus which provide software updates for many years (contrary to Samsung) helping users to use their phone longer.

If you are on Android, installing an alternative rom like [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) can make your old phone faster and increase its lifespan. Phones made by Google (Pixel serie) and flagship phones are usually well supported by alternative roms.

For laptop, you can have a look to brands like [Framework](https://frame.work/) and for computers it's better to buy one you can assemble, upgrade and fix yourself!
