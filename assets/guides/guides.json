[{"title":"Clean your cloud data","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Clean your cloud data</h1>\n<p>When your data is saved on the cloud, it means it's saved on remote computers (servers). It's really nice and convenient because if you lose your computer or your phone, your data is not lost!</p>\n<p>However, redundant data is not environmentally friendly at all and will never be. Remember this: every time you save data, transfer data it means CO2 emissions.</p>\n<p>Servers as well as your devices needs many rare metals but also because it needs electricity to work. For the servers, it's every single day of the year with no down time, to make sure you can access your data at any time of the day. As you know, electricity production always emits CO2, even if it's solar, windmills or nuclear. Yes, there is no &quot;green&quot; energy and solar panels manufacturing pollutes a lot.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the less emails you have on your mailbox, the less data you have on the cloud, the better for the environment.</p>\n<h3>More data = more pollution</h3>\n","key":".//clean-your-cloud-data.md"},{"title":"Avoid streaming","category":"digital","body":"<h1>Avoid streaming when possible</h1>\n<p>Streaming is nice, streaming is amazing, but have you ever thought about the consequences on the environment?</p>\n<p>To give you an idea on how bad the streaming is, let's take an example. The size of the article text in the English Wikipedia is around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia\">20 gigabytes</a> of data in 2020. It means that everytime you watch a season of the Walking Dead in HD (1080p), you have downloaded on your computer/phone the same amount of data as the entire Wikipedia encyclopaedia.</p>\n<p>Same applies to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and Youtube. Music is much smaller than a HD video but an average user consumes several songs in a day so at the end of the year, the impact of the climate is not negligeable.</p>\n<p>Both music and video streaming relies on servers as well as internet infrastructures to transport the data to you. All of this has a cost, so instead of streaming in all circumstances, try to listen to the radio, go the cinema.... Who knows, you might end up meeting real people in real life!</p>\n<p>Don't forget to cancel auto play by default, leading to unnecessary streaming like Youtube is doing. In most video streaming platform, you can save this behavior in the preferences. If you can, use Peertube, a decentralized and open-source video platform, much better for the environment compared to Youtube and more ethical.</p>\n<p>If you still want to use YouTube, we recommend <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-focus/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search\">Youtube Focus</a>, an add-on who tries to promote a healthier watching. As said on their <a href=\"https://github.com/Jompa14/YouTube_Focus\">Github</a>, YouTube has one billion hours watched daily, and it‚Äôs recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isn‚Äôt because they searched for something to watch or something to learn, it is because they were suggested by YouTube's algorithm.</p>\n","key":".//avoid-streaming.md"},{"title":"Eating seasonal and local","category":"home","body":"<h1>Eating seasonal fruits and vegetables</h1>\n<p>We all love tomatoes. But eating tomatoes during the whole year is not sustainable. During winter, we eat imported tomatoes or cultivated in greenhouses. And that‚Äôs a pity : tomatoes are more juicy and tasteful during summer. Respecting nature by eating seasonal fruit and vegetables can be a very interesting challenge to make you discover new ingredients such as black radish, lotus root or winter melon.</p>\n<h3>Fun fact¬†: cheese are also seasonal.</h3>\n<h1>Eating locally</h1>\n<p>You‚Äôre already eating less meat or you‚Äôre already vegetarian? Great! Next step, you can become a locavore, which means that the food you're eating is limited from an area of 50 to 200 kilometres. Of course, it‚Äôs easier to eat locally when you leaving in the countryside than in a big town.
