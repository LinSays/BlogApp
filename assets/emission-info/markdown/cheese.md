The top cheese consumer is Denmark with [28 kg](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-who-consume-the-most-cheese.html) of cheese consumption per capita, followed by Iceland and Finland. Making cheese requires a lot of milk: you'll need [6,5 litres](https://www.fromagesdechevre.com/chiffres-cles/) of milk to make 1 kg of goat cheese or [16 litres](https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/fr/2011/01/article_0005.html) of milk to make 1 kg of cow cheese like parmigiano reggiano.

Cows and goats females must be pregnant to produce milk and it's usually done by artificial insemination ([80% in the US](https://freefromharm.org/animal-cruelty-investigation/the-sexual-violation-of-dairy-cows-14-step-process-of-artificial-insemination/)). This constant cycle of impregnation creates a huge surplus of calves and lambs. Most female are used to replace the millions of still-young dairy cows and goat slaughtered each year when their total milk yields decline, while male are sold to be slaughtered.

The problem is, in order to produce milk, all animals have to eat and digest it. Like cows, sheep and goats are ruminants and emit methane during digestion, a strong greenhouse gas (GHG).
